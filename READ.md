# DNA Analysis Project

This project analyzes SARS-CoV-2 DNA sequences using Biopython and machine learning tools. It includes:
- Main analysis scripts for foundational DNA sequence processing.
- Bonus scripts with advanced features such as predictive modeling.

## Features
- DNA sequence handling using Biopython.
- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Machine learning preprocessing and modeling using Scikit-learn.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Required libraries: Biopython, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, tqdm

## How to Run
1. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run `dna_analysis_main.py` for foundational analysis.
3. Run `dna_analysis_bonus.py` for advanced analysis.
